## Usage Instructions for Instrument Recognition Program

To properly use the Instrument Recognition program, follow these steps to select the audio file:

1. **Activate Your Desired Audio File:**
   - Find the line in the Python file where the `audio_file` variable is set.
   - Remove the comment sign `#` from in front of the corresponding `audio_file` variable to activate it.

2. **Switching to a Different Audio File:**
   - Comment out the currently active `audio_file` variable by adding a `#` in front of it.
   - Then, remove the comment sign `#` from in front of the new `audio_file` variable you wish to use.

Ensure that only one `audio_file` variable is active at a time for the program to function correctly.
